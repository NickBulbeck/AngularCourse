To run this, may need to npm install json-server.
json-server db.json --watch; then you visit local host 3000/tracks

Now: to build an app.
Deploying it requires this to happen first. It uses webpack to create a distribution 
directory. 
In the dist/ folder, you can see a few files. The main.js is smaller
than yours; the user downloads the one index.html file, and the couple of js
files. In fact you could take the dist folder, and put it on a web server,
it'll run the entire website from there. You can cd into the dist folder, 
run http-server (which is installed globally here) and it'll serve up whatever
it finds; in this case, your angular app. Cool feature of http-server, there.

Netlify is a way of deploying apps for free. This is how you do it; drop your 
dist folder there.
