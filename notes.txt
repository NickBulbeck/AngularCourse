To put bootstrap in a Nangliar project, npm install bootstrap and add the following:
"node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"
to the angular.json styles object.

I think I've accidentally deleted a notes.txt file - there's a whole ton of notes that are missing.

Smart/dumb components: a smart component knows about the data, and where it comes from. A dumb
component is given data to render and it renders it. Or maybe produces some, which it transmits,
but it doesn't know what'll happen to it. The general idea is that most of the components should
be dumb. That makes the app easier to test and maintain.

(Note - the course manual, according to Stuart, isn't great on inputs and outputs because
the laddie who wrote it was too keen on Redux.)

Most of your components should be back-end agnostic. That is, inject dependencies in as few places
as possible. Few components should know or care about the back end.

Dependency injection
====================
(Consider also service-locator pattern; dependency injection is a pattern, apparently.)
A smart component depends on a service, let's say. So: the service is the dependency.

When you generate one, it's ng generate service <name>
