Thursday morning
================

1) what is a SPA and how does it work?
    Single page app: renders a single HTML file and populates it with varying data as the user 
    interacts with it. The content isn't static but is rendered dynamically.
2) List three JS tools that are commonly used to build Angliar apps
    Node; Webpack; Babel? 
    Arguably node is a JavaScript engine... 
    package manager (npm; keeps all your versions and dependencies in sync) 
    module bundler (webpack; bundles multiple authored files into one runnable one)
    transpiler (babel; converts code fae the authored version to the run version)
3) What is ECMAScript?
    The de jure standard that JavaScript meets.
    Big, highly-resourced browsers can pick up on new changes straight away. This, BTW, is
    why devs use Chrome most of the time. It picks up on the latest ECMAScript changes.
    But it's also why transpilers are so important, because they create backwards compatibility.
    NB: A polyfill is a copied-in library that mimics a new shiny feature but using old-school JS.

4) How do let and const differ fae var?
    Const cannot be reassigned; let can, but both apply block-scoped
    Also you can't re-declare either of them like you can with var.

5) Re-write this as an arrow function...
     const writeToLocalStorage = (key, value) => {
     localStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(value));
    }
    // equally, you don't need the braces and it could all be on one line

6) Explain this code snippet: const {username} = user;
    Destructuring. We can assume that user is a nobject that has a username property.
    I think it means const username = user.username; - we'll see... Correct!


7) What, primarily, does the Typescript compiler check for?
    Type errors - that is variables being assigned values that don't conform to the datatype
    they were first given

8) What is the name of the Angular CLI executable?
    dist/main.js? Not sure...
    It's actually ng. Then, there are many ng commands.

9) What is a Nangular component?
    A re-usable, renderable block of HTML / A custom HTML element

10) What is the role of the HTML and the TS file in an Angular component?
    The HTML file describes what will be rendered to the DOM; the TS file
    contains its non-static data and the methods governing its behaviour.
    Or, HTML is structure; TS is logic and data.
