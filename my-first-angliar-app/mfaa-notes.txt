Whatever you do, don't copy and paste an Angliar app.

When you first ng new app-name, cd into the directory and ng serve. This nodemon's stuff. 
It's a good idea to keep the terminal in view, though, as you'll see compilation errors in 
real time as you try to save errors.

Some stuff in the folder:
package.json you know. It's big.
node_modules you also know; it's big, too. A lot of them are only required for development, though.
tsconfig.json:
    - look at the target. es2016 or es2015 may be a better bet than 2020 that I've got.
angular.json:
    - lot of settings related to the project. Don't generally need to hack this.
src folder:
    Most of the work happens in here.
    index.html:
        - is the one html file, and it's all but empty. Everything is transpiled into the
        app-root element. It begins with app-, which means it's an angular custom component.
    srce/app folder:
        - start with 5 files. Four of them are the basic app.component that is the one component
        it has by default. You don't always need all four. You need the html file, and you nearly
        always need the ts file.
        - the first thing you do is completely empty app.component.html
        - the .ts file is a class component. The @Component thing is a "decorator". Anything that
        begins with an @ is a decorator. It's metadata.

When you add a new component, every one has to be listed in the app.module.ts file. So although in
theory you can create/remove a component by creating files, you'd have to change this file as
well. That's why it's better to use ng generate.
