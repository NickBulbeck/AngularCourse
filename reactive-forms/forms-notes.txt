Initially, Angular was called AngularJS. Everything was two-way
bound, so that any change in the view would affect the model and vice
versa. This wisnae great. In version 2, you had property-binding on
the view and event-binding on the model. But forms remain the exception:
in a form you want it to be two-way bound. When the user types in a text-bocx, 
we want it to affect the model, and we want changes to the model to be 
reflected in the form.
There's >1 way of doing a form, but we're doing reactive forms.

You need to update app.module with the reactive forms hingmy - see app.module file.

If you console.log() the FormGroup object, you get some really interesting stuff.
We'll use some of these. For instance, FormGroup.value returns an object with all
the values of the form in it.

ng-classes - you've seen this in ContactsDashboard.  You can overwrite these ng 
classes in the css for the form, and angular adds them automatically.
